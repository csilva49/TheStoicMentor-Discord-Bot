# TheStoicMentor-Discord-Bot

Welcome to The Stoic Mentor Bot

INTRODUCTION

This bot has two main functions, stoic quotes and journaling.

Stoic quotes - If the user inputs the command /quote, the bot gathers data from an API and shows a random stoic quote!

Journaling - Using the /journal "message" command, the user can input a private message to their personal journal. This journal is stored inside a database. The users can see their entries with the command /myjournal.

CONFIGURATION

Because the bot is only in development phase, the config file is not present in this repository.
